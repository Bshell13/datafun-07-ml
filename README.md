## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge and understaning of machine learning (ML). More specifically, this project will employ simple linear regressions to train a model using data and make predictions along the way.<br>
Here are the things that will be covered in the project:
-  Build a model
-  Make predictions
-  Visualize the model
-  Publish your insights
