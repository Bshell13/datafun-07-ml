# datafun-07-ml

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge and understaning of machine learning (ML). More specifically, this project will employ simple linear regressions to train a model using data and make predictions along the way.<br>
Here are the things that will be covered in the project:
-  Build a model
-  Make predictions
-  Visualize the model
-  Publish your insights

There is a bonus example at the end for California Housing Values. It will compare different models and give a R^2 score to choose the best model for predictions.

Here are some requirements to do before starting.
